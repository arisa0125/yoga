            <br>
            <p>Cardo's "Beginner Yoga" is a program that helps      beginners to become familiar with yoga. You can learn basic breathing techniques and meditation while slowly and carefully performing each of the poses, focusing on poses that are the least difficult in yoga, and you can learn the essential attractions of yoga. <br>
                Cardo's studio is a hot and humid hot yoga studio. If you are new to hot yoga, we recommend the beginner yoga program. The amount of exercise is relatively small, so if you feel that your body is stiff, or if you want to try new yoga, you can work with peace of mind. <br>
                In the beginner yoga program, you will experience the fun of yoga while stretching the muscles around the pelvis and scapula, which tend to become stiff in everyday life, and experiencing the exhilarating feeling of deep breathing. It also relieves your tired body with yoga poses and relaxes your mental stress, so it is reputed that you can refresh your mind and body after the end. In addition, since it teaches carefully how to breathe, which is said to be difficult for beginners to learn, it is a program that even beginners who want to continue yoga for a long time can take with confidence.

            <p>
              Cardo's "Basic Yoga" is a program that exercises a good balance of the basic poses and breathing methods of "Hatayoga" to move your whole body. Each pose is carefully done to develop a sense of facing one's body, while being able to check the state of mind through meditation. The difficulty level is beginner level, so even those who feel that their body is hard or who are not confident in their physical strength can participate with peace of mind. This is a program that focuses on the basic movements of yoga, such as the breathing method peculiar to yoga, how to move the body, and how to stretch the muscles, so even beginners can take classes with confidence. Also, since the method of breathing yoga and basic poses are the main focus, it is also perfect for those who want to keep their mind and body healthy and beautiful from the inside. In addition, since all Cardo yoga programs are based on basic yoga, many beginners as well as intermediate/advanced students take this course to check the basics. <br>
              In this way, Cardo's Basic Yoga is a recommended program for beginners to advanced students, and many people support it, saying that “whenever you participate, you will discover new things”.

              <br>
                <p>
                  There are several styles and styles of yoga, but the most basic is "Hatayoga". Take a basic pose while repeating the deep breaths of inhaling and exhaling well. Hatha yoga is so old in origin that there are various theories in history, but it is said that it started around the 10th to 13th century AD. <br>
                  The original purpose of yoga was to deepen meditation while taking deep breaths. For this reason, yoga postures have been used to maintain the mind and body, and to make it easier to meditate. <br>
                  In Sanskrit, “ha” means sun = breath, and “tha” means moon = breath. The sun and the moon symbolize the opposing things of the world, such as the sun and the shade, the top and the bottom, the man and the woman, the mind and the body. On the other hand, the word "yoga" has the meaning of "connect." Hatha yoga has the meaning of connecting and harmonizing conflicting things. <br>
                  Cardo's Hatha Yoga lessons focus on the basic poses of all yoga. Even if you are doing yoga for the first time or if you are worried about the hardness of your body, it is a content that you can join without difficulty. It's a great program for learning the basics of yoga. Please practice while paying attention to the breathing (balance between inhaling and exhaling), which is the characteristic of Hatha Yoga.
